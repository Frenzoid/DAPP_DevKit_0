# Hardhat & NextJs
### Automated template dapp development kit
</div>

#### This repository is a template for Dapps, and has the following cool caracteristics:

- Automated Contract verification.
- Automated ABI and Address linkage to the frontend app ( NextJS ).
- Automated frontend upload w/Surge.

#### What does this mean?

When you deploy a contract, the contract will be verified, the artifacts, abis and address of the contract will be generated in the frontend, and the React app will automatically have a predefined configuration so you can simply generate a signer and a contract instance, without the need to specify the contract abis or adress.


#### Where to start:

- `backend`: Simple hardhat project, check out the scripts and config.
- `frontend`: NextJS app, check out configs and pages.

<br>

##### Backend.
###### 1)
Go at `/backend/.env_examples` and fill out the gaps.
Check out how thats used on `hardhat.config.js` and `./scripts/deploy.js`.

###### 2)
After that, customize the contract and your `./scripts/deploy.js` ( specify name and constructor args of the contract ).

###### 3)
Once youre done, there are a few cmds you can check out on the below seciton. Try running a hardhat node, and deploying the contract to this node.
    - `npm run node` and in another terminal `npm run deploy-local`.

##### Frontend.
###### 4)
Lets go to our frontend, check `./pages/index.js` for some sample code.

###### 5)
 You'll notice that you'll be able to access the `CONTRACT_ABI, CONTRACT_ADDRESS, DEPLOYED_NETWORK, DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` from `constants.js`, theres no need to change these values, since each time you deploy your contract with hardhat, `backend/scripts/deploy.js `will update these variables to the latest deployed contract, and you'll have direct access to them from these variables in your `config/constanst.js` file.

  There are 2 components, `index.js` and `greeter.js`, in this case, `index.js` manages all web3modal processes and signer, provider and contract instance creation. `greeter.js` is just a component that renders a body, and interacts with the deployed contract.

You can use those 2 files as an example on how to interact with the ethereum ecosystem on the frontend ( providers, signers, contract, network and acc changes, etc.. ).

###### 6)
Run `npm run dev` to start the nextJs dev server, try and tinker with the app!

###### 7)
Once your frontend is ready, lets deploy it to the internet! Run `npm run deploy`, wait for the build to finish, think of a cool domain name, input it when surge asks you ( mydomain.surger.sh for example ), and tadaaa :D, your dapp is on the internet!!. You can check the current example of the code deployed at https://greeter.surge.sh.


#### Commands ( node scripts ):
- backend:
    - `npm run node`: Runs a local hardhat node ( localhost network ).
    - `npm run compile`: Compiles contract.
    - `npm run deploy-local`: Deploys contract to local hardhat network.
    - `npm run deploy-rinkeby`: Deploys and verifies contract to rinkeby test network.
    - `npm run deploy-ropsten`: Deploys and verifies contract to ropsten test network.
    - `npm run deploy-mumbai`: Deploys and verifies contract to mumbai test network.
    - `npm run test`: Runs hardhat tests ( runs files inside `test/` ).
- frontend:
    - `npm run dev`: Runs nextJs development server.
    - `npm run start`: Runs React development server.
    - `npm run build`: Builds nextJs app source code ( packing ).
    - `npm run export`: Exports app to `./out`, ready to be hosted online :D.
    - `npm run surge`: Runs Surge client, used to upload the ./out folder on a surge web host, check current domains, etc.
    - `npm run deploy`: Runs npm build, export and surge, one in all command.
    - `npm run lint`: Runs linter.
